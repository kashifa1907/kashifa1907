        is a colourful, swan-sized bird, with a fan-shaped crest of feathers,<br>
         a white patch under the eye and a long, slender neck. <br>
         The male of the species is more colourful than the female,<br>
          with a glistening blue breast and neck and a spectacular bronze-green tail <br>
          of around 200 elongated feathers. <br>

          fanning out the tail and preening its feathers is a gorgeous sight."</div>
